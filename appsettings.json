{
  // The "ConnectionStrings" section typically contains one or more database connection strings.
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    // Here's the connection string named "MyDatabase". It provides the necessary information for a program to connect to a specific SQL Server instance and database.
    "MyDatabase": "Server=BRZO-PILE\\SQLEXPRESS; DataBase=Animal_Database; Integrated Security=true; Encrypt=False;"
  }
}

// Server=BRZO-PILE\SQLEXPRESS;
// This specifies the server name (BRZO-PILE) and the SQL Server instance name (SQLEXPRESS). This is the machine and SQL Server instance where your database resides.
//
// DataBase=Animal_Database;
// Specifies the name of the database you want to connect to, in this case, Animal_Database.
//
// Integrated Security=true;
// This means that the application will use Windows Authentication to connect to the SQL Server, rather than SQL Server Authentication. Windows Authentication is typically more secure because it uses Windows user credentials, avoiding the need to store usernames and passwords in the connection string.
//
// Encrypt=False;
// This indicates whether or not the connection should be encrypted. Setting it to false means the data transferred between the application and SQL Server won't be encrypted. Depending on the environment and the sensitivity of the data, you might consider enabling this for added security.
// This configuration is typically stored in appsettings.json in a .NET Core project and is used to externalize settings so that they can be changed without modifying the code.
